# Clay

Designer is a mobile design environment for Clay.

You use Designer to define
process, interconnectivity, and intelligence into your own projects
made with Clay devices. You can, for example, define connectivity across
Clay devices, controlling electronic peripherals connected to a patch and
communications between devices. In simple terms, Designer visualizes your
system and gives you tools for manipulating the data structures that underly
your project's system behavior by creating, copy, and curating from other
projects.

You might wonder why Designers exists along with
[Looper](https://github.com/computercamp/Looper). After all, Looper is also
a tool for programming Clay, too. The answer is simple! Both Sequencer and
Looper are experimental programming environments for Clay. We are building
both of them because we want to test multiple designs that are quite
different by actually programming Clay.

Generally speaking, Designer is programmatically simpler than Looper because
it is built using the native list widgets. Looper implements a custom
graphical design language.

## Dependencies

We used open source software to build Clay. Here's what we're using:

*   [FloatingActionButton](https://github.com/Clans/FloatingActionButton/)

We also used the
[Android Asset Studio](http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/index.html)'s
Generic Icon Generator.
