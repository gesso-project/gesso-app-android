# Sequencer

Sequencer is a tool for programming Clay by creating and manipulating sequences of basic system behaviors such as controlling electronic components conected to a device and communications between devices.

You might wonder why Sequencer exists along with [Looper](https://github.com/computercamp/Looper). After all, Looper is also a tool for programming Clay, too. The answer is simple! Both Sequencer and Looper are experimental programming environments for Clay. We are building both of them because we want to test multiple designs that are quite different by actually programming Clay.

Generally speaking, Sequencer is programmatically simpler than Looper because it is built using the native list widgets. Looper implements a custom graphical design language.
