# Gesso

This repository contains the code for the Gesso Android app.

The Gesso app is used to define the tasks executed by boards, including those 
to control connected sensor and actuator components, participate in 
communications between boards and with Internet services using protocols such
as HTTP.

On a high level, the Gesso app is used to compose three types of behaviors
supported by Gesso boards: (1) interconnectivity, (2) interactivity, and 
(3) intelligence. Together the tasks composed together from these categories
defines the functionality of the systems built for projects.

You can, for example, define connectivity across
Gesso boards, controlling electronic peripherals connected to a extensionEntity and
communications between devices. In simple terms, Designer visualizes your
system and gives you tools for manipulating the data structures that underly
your project's system behavior by creating, copy, and curating from other
projects.
